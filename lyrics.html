      Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
      Is it that sweet? I guess so
      Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
      That's that me, espresso
      
      Move it up, down, left, right, oh
      Switch it up like Nintendo
      Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
      That's that me, espresso
      I can't relate to desperation
      My 'give a fucks' are on vacation
      And I got this one boy
      And he won't stop calling
      When they act this way
      I know I got 'em
      
      Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
      Walked in and dream came trued it for ya
      Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
      I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
      That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
      One touch and I brand newed it for ya
      Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
      Is it that sweet? I guess so
      Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
      That's that me, espresso
      
      Move it up, down, left, right, oh
      Switch it up like Nintendo
      Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
      That's that me, espresso
      
      Is it that sweet? I guess so
      I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
      Oh, he looks so cute wrapped around my finger
      My twisted humor, make him laugh so often
      My honey bee, come and get this pollen
      Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
      Walked in and dream came trued it for ya
      Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
      I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
      That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
      One touch and I brand newed it for ya
      Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
      Is it that sweet? I guess so
      Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
      That's that me, espresso
      
      Move it up, down, left, right, oh
      Switch it up like Nintendo
      Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
      That's that me, espresso
      
      He's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
      Is it that sweet? I guess so
      Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
      That's that me, espresso
      
      Move it up, down, left, right, oh
      Switch it up like Nintendo
      Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
      That's that me, espresso
      
      Is it that sweet? I guess so
      That's that me, espresso
